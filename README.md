## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
Data Consistency:
Ensuring consistency in units and timeframes across different datasets was a challenge.
Complex Visualization Requirements:

Some questions required complex visualizations, and deciding on the most effective approach was challenging.
Limited Time:

Balancing the time spent on each question and ensuring completion within the allocated timeframe was a challenge.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would:
Conduct further exploratory analysis to uncover additional insights.
Refine visualizations for enhanced clarity and aesthetics.
Explore more advanced statistical analyses to strengthen conclusions.
Consider additional external factors that might influence the trends observed in the data.
Seek feedback from peers or mentors to improve the overall quality of the project.
