# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The Canadian real estate market has undergone significant transformations in the last four decades, shaping the economic landscape of the nation. This Tableau analysis delves into diverse datasets sourced from the Canadian Open Data portal, encompassing weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, and various indices. My exploration here seeks to unravel nuanced trends, correlations, and potential impacts on consumer behavior, particularly in the context of economic crises and market fluctuations. By harnessing the power of Tableau, this report aims to provide stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers with visual insights into the dynamic interplay between housing dynamics, economic indices, and societal spending patterns, fostering mY goal here is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ever-evolving Canadian real estate ecosystem.


## Process
### Data Collection:
The analysis is based on datasets sourced from the Canadian Open Data portal, encompassing weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, and economic indices. The data spans multiple decades, offering a comprehensive view of the Canadian real estate landscape.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Prior to Tableau analysis, rigorous data cleaning processes were employed to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and validating data coherence across different datasets. Inconsistencies and outliers were identified and addressed to prevent skewing of results. Additionally, data from disparate sources were harmonized to facilitate seamless integration into Tableau.

### Tableau Integration:
Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, was employed for its versatility and user-friendly interface. The cleaned datasets were imported into Tableau, and relationships between variables were established. Custom calculations and aggregations were performed to derive meaningful insights, and various visualization types were utilized to effectively communicate trends, comparisons, and correlations within the datasets.

### Interactive Dashboards:
The final step involved the creation of interactive dashboards in Tableau, enabling dynamic exploration of the data. Filters, parameters, and tooltips were incorporated to enhance user interactivity, providing stakeholders with an intuitive and informative visual representation of the complex real estate and economic dynamics in Canada.



## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
Data Consistency:
Ensuring consistency in units and timeframes across different datasets was a challenge.
Complex Visualization Requirements:

Some questions required complex visualizations, and deciding on the most effective approach was challenging.
Limited Time:

Balancing the time spent on each question and ensuring completion within the allocated timeframe was a challenge.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would:
Conduct further exploratory analysis to uncover additional insights.
Refine visualizations for enhanced clarity and aesthetics.
Explore more advanced statistical analyses to strengthen conclusions.
Consider additional external factors that might influence the trends observed in the data.
Seek feedback from peers or mentors to improve the overall quality of the project.
