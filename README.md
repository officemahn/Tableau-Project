# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The Canadian real estate market has undergone significant transformations in the last four decades, shaping the economic landscape of the nation. This Tableau analysis delves into diverse datasets sourced from the Canadian Open Data portal, encompassing weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, and various indices. My exploration here seeks to unravel nuanced trends, correlations, and potential impacts on consumer behavior, particularly in the context of economic crises and market fluctuations. By harnessing the power of Tableau, this report aims to provide stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers with visual insights into the dynamic interplay between housing dynamics, economic indices, and societal spending patterns. My goal here is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ever-evolving Canadian real estate ecosystem.


## Process
### Data Collection:
The analysis is based on datasets sourced from the Canadian Open Data portal, encompassing weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, and economic indices. The data spans multiple decades, offering a comprehensive view of the Canadian real estate landscape.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Prior to Tableau analysis, rigorous data cleaning processes were employed to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and validating data coherence across different datasets. Inconsistencies and outliers were identified and addressed to prevent skewing of results. Additionally, data from disparate sources were harmonized to facilitate seamless integration into Tableau.

### Tableau Integration:
Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, was employed for its versatility and user-friendly interface. The cleaned datasets were imported into Tableau, and relationships between variables were established. Custom calculations and aggregations were performed to derive meaningful insights, and various visualization types were utilized to effectively communicate trends, comparisons, and correlations within the datasets.

### Interactive Dashboards:
The final step involved the creation of interactive dashboards in Tableau, enabling dynamic exploration of the data. Filters, parameters, and tooltips were incorporated to enhance user interactivity, providing stakeholders with an intuitive and informative visual representation of the complex real estate and economic dynamics in Canada.



## Results
Project Option 1
### Key Findings & Trends:

- House Price Index Ascendancy: The House Price Index consistently showed an upward trend from 2001 to 2022, indicating sustained growth in the real estate market.

- Earnings Growth: Average weekly earnings, inclusive of overtime, also exhibited a positive trajectory over the years, revealing an increase in income levels.

- Relative Disparity: While both house prices and earnings increased, there is a noticeable gap in the growth rates, with house prices outpacing the rise in average weekly earnings.

- Affordability Challenge: The growing disparity between house prices and earnings suggests potential challenges for individuals aspiring to enter the housing market. This could impact overall affordability and access to homeownership.

- Policy Implications: Policymakers may need to address affordability concerns, considering the sustained growth in house prices compared to earnings, to ensure a balanced and accessible housing market for a broader segment of the population.

- Market Dynamics: The insights underscore the importance of monitoring and managing the dynamics between housing prices and earnings to promote a sustainable and inclusive real estate market.
  

Visualisations:
- Created a time series line chart to show the trend of house prices over the last 40 years.
- Utilized a line chart to compare the trends of house and office prices, highlighting the rate of increase.
- Generated a heatmap to visually represent current house prices across different districts in Canada.
- Employed a bar chart to compare the trends of earnings and house prices over time.
- Created a bar chart to compare the percentage of earnings spent in 2014 and 2001.
- Developed multiple line charts to illustrate the impact of four economic crises on various indicators.
- Plotted a scatter plot with a regression line to explore the relationship between the consumer index and house prices.


## Challenges 
### Data Consistency:
Ensuring consistency in units and timeframes across different datasets was a challenge.

### Complex Visualization Requirements:
Some questions required complex visualizations, and deciding on the most effective approach was challenging.

### Limited Time:
Balancing the time spent on each question and ensuring completion within the allocated timeframe was a challenge.

## Future Goals
- Conduct further exploratory analysis to uncover additional insights.
- Refine visualizations for enhanced clarity and aesthetics.
- Explore more advanced statistical analyses to strengthen conclusions.
- Consider additional external factors that might influence the trends observed in the data.
